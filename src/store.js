        "I worked in the role of an 'integration engineer' for this project, which meant I was a part of all aspects of the design and construction process - which included designing and fabricating the final object while also working on both the code, the C.V. and the electronics.",
      what: "A simple drawing bar fitted out with computer vision sensors and servos, allowing for an inconspicuous looking object to be a mischievous parter in the crime of drawing. We want to intervene and add another character in the drawing experience by disrupting it with an unexpected, seemingly mischievous character that reduces the precise control that the artist has over their canvas."
